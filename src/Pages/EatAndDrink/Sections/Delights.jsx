        In the Atlantic Provinces, lobster is the star, as are the cod cheeks
        from Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. Quebec, in addition to having many
        French influences, is the world's leading producer of delicious maple
        syrup. Montreal and Toronto are two large cosmopolitan cities that love
        good food and boast numerous gourmet restaurants, although the most
        typical dish of Eastern Canada is undoubtedly Poutine, made up of French
        fries, cheese and gravy! The Great North and its provinces will offer
        you a true culinary experience, try boiled seal, char and crispy whale
        skin. In Canada there is no shortage of cowboys and consequently beef to
        be consumed in the famous steakhouses of Alberta. In the Rocky Mountains
        area you will find venison, bison and moose, while the rest of British
        Columbia will amaze you with delicious wild salmon, Fanny Bay oysters
        and fruit from the Okanagan Valley.{" "}

          And if you're worried that you won't be able to drink great wine in
          Canada, think again quickly. The Okanagan Valley in British Columbia
          and the Niagara Peninsula in Ontario are two of the best areas for
          great tastings. Craft beers are also delicious and microbreweries are
          increasingly popular, especially in the green British Columbia!
