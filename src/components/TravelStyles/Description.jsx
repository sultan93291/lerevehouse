        <p>Engaged in ecologically sustainable tourism and adventure, Le RÃªve House travels include a wide range of outdoor activities to meet the needs of those travelers who are not content with admiring views and attractions from the windows of their cars or from various means of transport, but they wish to immerse themselves in nature that are gradually discovering.</p>
        <p className='mt-7 lg:mt-10'>We will make you approach orcas and whales and even caress them, on kayaks, on typical Mexican lances or on fast zodiac inflatable boats. Launch yourself on steel cables between the highest peaks of trees of lush forests, ride a horse, go trekking or pedaling along the striking Rocky Trails, run over the dunes of Oregon in dune buggies, dive into the clear waters of a cenote in Yucatan, be watching the colorful wildlife of the second longest coral reef in the globe... In short, the list is very long and, as you say, there is only the embarrassment of choice.</p>
